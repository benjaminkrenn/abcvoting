## Python implementations of approval-based committee (multi-winner) rules

Approval-based committee rules (ABC rules) are voting methods for selecting a committee, i.e., a fixed-size subset of candidates.
ABC rules are also known as approval-based multi-winner rules.
The input of such rules are [approval ballots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting#/media/File:Approval_ballot.svg).
We recommend the survey by Faliszewski et al. [1] as an introduction to this topic and for further reference.
The following ABC rules are implemented:

* Approval Voting (AV)

* Satisfaction Approval Voting (SAV)

* Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) [Gurobi optional]

* Sequential Proportional Approval Voting

* Reverse Sequential Proportional Approval Voting

* Sainte-Lagu&euml; Approval Voting (SLAV) [4]

* Sequential Sainte-Lagu&euml; Approval Voting [4]

* Approval Chamberlin-Courant (CC) [Gurobi optional]

* Sequential Chamberlin-Courant

* Reverse Sequential Chamberlin-Courant

* Phragmen's sequential rule (see [2])
  
* Monroe [Gurobi optional]

* Minimax Approval Voting (see [3])

* Greedy Monroe (see [5])

* Rule X (see [6])

*  Phragmen's first method (Enestroem's method) 

## Example

The following code computes the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule for a profile with 6 voters and 5 candidates.

```python
from preferences import Profile
import rules_approval

profile = Profile(5)
profile.add_preferences([[0,1,2], [0,1], [0,1], [1,2], [3,4], [3,4]])
committeesize = 3
print rules_approval.compute_pav(profile, committeesize, ilp=False)
```
The output is 
```
[[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 4]]
```
which corresponds to the two committees {0,1,3} and {0,1,4}. Further examples can be found in [examples/examples.py](examples/examples.py), [examples/file_examples.py](examples/file_examples.py) and [examples/random_profile_examples.py](examples/random_profile_examples.py).

## Comments

* This module requires Python 2.7+ or 3.6+.
* The used modules can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
* Most computationally hard rules are also implemented via the ILP solver [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/). The corresponding functions require [gurobipy](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/the_gurobi_python_interfac.html).
* Some functions use fractions (e.g., `compute_seqphragmen`). These compute significantly faster if the module [gmpy2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/) is available. If gmpy2 is not available, the much slower Python module [fractions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/fractions.html) is used.
* All voting methods have a parameter `resolute`. If it is set to true, only one winning committee is computed. In most cases,  `resolute=True` speeds up the computation. 
* For ILP implementations via Gurobi it is not guaranteed that all winning committees are computed even if `resolute = False`.
